## Webpack 5 Boilerplate

This is a simple Webpack 5 boilerplate with Bootstrap 5 included.
All that's needed is to clone this repo and run  `npm install` and after that `npm run dev`. There's also an alternative `build` script for just compiling without the *Hot Module Reload* feature.

We are ready to rock!
